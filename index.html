<h1>TetraDefense</h1>
<h2><a href="tetraDefense.html">Play</a></h2>
<h2>How to play</h2>

1. The red curve shows the path that enemies will take<br>
2. Click to place towers. The blue timer at the top right shows cooldown until you can place again<br>
3. Press spacebar to rotate the tetrad before placing it (may not work on your first tetrad)<br>
4. If you place 4 tetrads in a pattern to make a larger tetrad, it will create a superior mega tetrad.<br>
